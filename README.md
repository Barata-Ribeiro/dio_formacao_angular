# Angular Studies Repository

This repository is dedicated to my studies on Angular, one of the most sought-after frameworks when it comes to Single Page Applications (SPAs). This repository contains projects of a large scale developed with Angular, exploring the power of working with a componentized front end.

Here, you'll find examples and code snippets exploring various aspects of Angular, such as data binds, simplified API consumption, best practices for project organization, and much more. All of this is practiced in completely decoupled solutions.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

1. `1-webComponents` - Working with Web Components in the Front-end
2. `2-TypeScript_Angular` - TypeScript for Angular
3. `3-WorkingWithComponents` - Working with Angular Components
4. `4-LifeCycle_Hooks_Angular` - LifeCycle Hooks Angular
5. `5-Directives` - Directives in Angular
6. `6-modules` - Angular Modules
7. `7-routes` - Working with Routes in Angular
8. `8-services` - Working with Services in Angular
9. `9-guards` - Working with Guards in Angular
